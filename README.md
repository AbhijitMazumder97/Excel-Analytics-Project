## Tools and Techniques used for data analysis: ##

#### 1. Power Query:

•	Extracting the data from the csv files/workbooks/folders to Power Query
•	Performing essential transformations on the extracted data by promoting headers, checking for errors (if any) and replacing the same with correct values, changing data types, creating custom columns, generating new queries either by reference or by generating a blank query.
•	Direct referencing one query from another 
•	Grouping all dimension and fact queries to separate folders.
•	Loading the transformed data to the data model.

#### 2. Power Pivot:
•	Establishing connections between dimension and fact tables using Data modelling.
•	Importing useful columns into your fact table from dimension table after establishing connections.
•	Generating calculated columns using DAX formulas.
•	Creating new measures and editing them (as per requirement) in the Data Model using DAX formulas.
#### 3. Pivot Tables:
•	Using the data in the data model and summarizing it quickly and easily.
•	Performing “Slice and dice” operations to generate reports as per our requirement.
•	Value-Field formatting to display large metrics figures in short custom number formats.
•	Creating custom “Pivot Table Style” to beautify the reports by selectively manipulating the borders, font styles for respective rows and columns.
#### 4. Conditional Formatting:
•	Highlighting the metrics figures in order to ensure easy comparison based on their color shades.
•	Using data bars to highlight the percentage values in the growth column.
